I just wanted to import all modules into my Obsidian Vault for tagging and quick access to acquired knowledge.
There was some logic behind when trying to spider, thats why my spagetti code is so long.

I AM NOT A CODER, spagetti code warning. 

I wanted to add a function that doesnt execute requests if module already in vault, but I finished making it simpler and not write new files if already existing. (Idea requests much better)
